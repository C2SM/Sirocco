!!! warning "Needs configuration"
    Note that MathJax is included via a `script` tag on this page and is not
    configured in the generated default configuration to avoid including it
    in a pages that do not need it. See the documentation for details on how
    to configure it on all your pages if they are more Maths-heavy than these
    simple starter pages.

<script id="MathJax-script" src="https://unpkg.com/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
<script>
  window.MathJax = {
    tex: {
      inlineMath: [["\\(", "\\)"]],
      displayMath: [["\\[", "\\]"]],
      processEscapes: true,
      processEnvironments: true
    },
    options: {
      ignoreHtmlClass: ".*|",
      processHtmlClass: "arithmatex"
    }
  };

  document$.subscribe(() => {
    MathJax.startup.output.clearCache()

    MathJax.texReset()
    MathJax.typesetPromise()
  })
